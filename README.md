API:Suomi 2.0 Requirements
============
![](http://apisuomi.fi/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/apisuomi-big-round.png)

This document is a lightweight requirements documentation for {API:Suomi} 2.0 service. 

## Driving idea: 
* HTML5/JQuery based frontend 
* which uses Node.js driven public and open API to pull and store data.  

## Documentation model for requirements

Requirements will be documented from *the user's point of view*, as scrum user stories (epics). Form is as follows; As a (end user role), I want (the desire) so that (the rationale).

Simple example: As an API developer I want to be able to add new API to repository so that it will be publically available.
