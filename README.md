API:Suomi 2.0 Requirements
============

This document is a lightweight requirements documentation for {API:Suomi} 2.0 service. 

## Driving idea: 
* HTML5/JQuery based frontend 
* which uses Node.js driven public and open API to pull and store data.  

## Documentation model for requirements

Requirements will be documented from *the user's point of view*, as scrum user stories (epics). Form is as follows; As a (end user role), I want (the desire) so that (the rationale).

Simple example: As an API developer I want to be able to add new API to repository so that it will be publically available.

Features:
* As a developer I want to be able to update any given attribute on listed APIs (which I'm entitled to do so)
* As an API publisher I want to be able to write API description with RAML and use that file as data input or update for listed API
* As a program I want to list all APIs, paged
* As a developer, I want to be able to add single API to listing via API and graphical UI
* As a developer, I want to be able to remove single API to listing via API and graphical UI
* As a developer, I want to be able to update API attributes via API and graphical UI
*
